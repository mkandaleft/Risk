# Risk
The project is organized as such:
- src folder for .cpp source code files
- include for all .h header files
- AllHeaders.h contains all header files to avoid redundancy (If you add a header file, please include it here also)
- obj folder is for compiled code
- Driver contains main(), maybe we can also put it in src/
- testing is for testing files, not sure yet how to use it
- myprogram is executable file
