# Risk
The project is organized as such:
- src folder for .cpp source code files
- include for all .h header files
- AllHeaders.h contains all header files to avoid redundancy (If you add a header file, please include it here also)
- obj folder is for compiled code
- Driver contains main(), maybe we can also put it in src/
- testing is for testing files, not sure yet how to use it
- myprogram is executable file

The Hand, Order, OrderList and Territory classes are practice versions to test Player class, feel free to change them.

Add your own files or work on existing files, if you change the name of files or classes please let us know so we can adjust 
the other classes for proper functionning. For any questions, let me (Mark) know (:
